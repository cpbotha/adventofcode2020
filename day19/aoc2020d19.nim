# part 1 plan ====
# - we want LUT with rulenum: regexp including
# - ok, at least I had the idea early on to pack rules into regexps
# - in spite of that, only had suitable data representation at third try (went to the beach in between)
#   1. seq of seqs nope
#   2. packing rulenums as ASCII chars into strings nope
#   3. map string to seq[string] in input Dict, string to regexp string in final dict yeah

# part 2 plan =====
# - whimper
# - based on the two newly recursive rules, wrote out some examples of what would be valid
# - looking at patterns there, it seemed changing rule 42 to 42+ (i.e. one or more) and 31 to 31+
#   would work. This did work for the demo data, but not for the real data :(
