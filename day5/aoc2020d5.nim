# Saturday, could only get started quite late

# One of my first thoughts was: This feels a lot like binary.
# Let's try the example:
# FBFBBFF
# 0  1  0 1 1 0 0
#64 32 16 8 4 2 1
# = 44
# haha nice

# 128 rows and 8 columns of seats on the plane
# seats on very front and very back are also missing
# my seat is missing
# "the seats with IDs +1 and -1 from yours will be in your list"
# what is my seatId? == find gaps in ID
