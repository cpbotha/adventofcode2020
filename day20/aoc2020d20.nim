# part 1 plan =====
# - edge-matching puzzle with flips
# - encode each edge as binary number
# - matching edges are equal
# - if you flip a tile UD, only its LR side numbers are flipped, and vice versa.
#   - iow if you flip one edge, you have to flip the other
#   - do rotations after this
# - lookup table from edge number to tile number
# - backtracking could perhaps work
# - after a first check, it turns out that unflipped edges occur at most twice
#   iow not as hard as it appeared at first sight
