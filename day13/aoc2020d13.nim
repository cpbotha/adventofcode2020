# gave up on part 2 after 1.5 hours

# from reddit it looks like when you have modular problems like this, bust out Chinese Remainder Theorem
# in this case, was more straight-forward to notice prime numbers, then multiple them incrementally
# together for new step as you find more buses that work

# a ≡ b (mod n)
# means a and b are congruent modulo n
# a - b is divisible by n
# our problem is specified as a + b is divisible by n
# in theory should negate the residuals then plug into CRT

# also:

# The trick with part 2 was to quickly recognise that you could iterate over the
# numbers with a larger step value than 1. Once you find a satisfying value for
# each bus, you can then make the step value be the lowest common multiple of
# its current value and that bus. Fortunately the bus numbers were all mutually
# prime, so we didn't need to implement lowest common multiple and could simply
# multiply the step value.

# in other words:
# start from t until you find a t that satisfies the first bus, i.e. t mod bus == offset
# set step = found_bus
# when you find next bus, set step = found_buses.foldl(a*b)
# if the bus numbers were not prime, would have had to use LCM of found buses, or LCM of current step and new bus
