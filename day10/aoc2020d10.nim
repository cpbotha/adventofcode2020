# - start part 1 at 08:04, completed at around 08:25
# - part 2: I could not get my backtracking to work on the full data. Gave up,
#   started looking at other people's solutions. (backtracking does work
#   on the toy datasets, so there's that)

# next time:
# - try to sketch out the toy dataset and its deltas
# - then go through seeing what happens when you remove adapters
# - notice that delta=1 can permute, delta=2 does not exist, delta=3 HAVE to remain
# - try to notice how the sub-solutions (windows of three adapters before the
#   current) accumulate into the total solution

# p1
# - input file has rated output joltages of adapters
# - each adapter can take input 1,2 or 3 jolts lower than its output
# - device rated for 3 jolts higher than highest adapter
# - charging outlet 0 jolts

# p2
# find subset Xk of Xm so that:
# 1 <= xn - xn-1 <= 3
# sum(xn - xn-1) = device
# 
# brute force:
# 104 adapters
# each adapter can be present or not, so 2^104 permutations
# BUT: an adapter can only be removed if the one at its output is <=3V

# backtracking
# - go through the whole set: if an adapter could be removed, that's a tree branch
# - for each branch, remove that adapter
#   - go through the set with the branch removed, for each OTHER adapter that can be removed, make a new branch
# - when done building the graph, count the nodes

# part 2 solutions from reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/ka8z8x/2020_day_10_solutions/
# - dynamic programming, which is super fast, and is quite generic
# - peeps recognizing that sequences of joltage difference 1 result in specific
#   numbers of permutations for that sub-sequence
