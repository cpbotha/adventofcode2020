# p1
# - input file has rated output joltages of adapters
# - each adapter can take input 1,2 or 3 jolts lower than its output
# - device rated for 3 jolts higher than highest adapter
# - charging outlet 0 jolts

# p2
# find subset Xk of Xm so that:
# 1 <= xn - xn-1 <= 3
# sum(xn - xn-1) = device
# 
# brute force:
# 104 adapters
# each adapter can be present or not, so 2^104 permutations
# BUT: an adapter can only be removed if the one at its output is <=3V

# backtracking
# - go through the whole set: if an adapter could be removed, that's a tree branch
# - for each branch, remove that adapter
#   - go through the set with the branch removed, for each OTHER adapter that can be removed, make a new branch
# - when done building the graph, count the nodes
# start at level 0, the whole set. level 1 is a seq of hashsets, where each hashset contains only the removed adapter idx
# level 2 is a seq of hashsets, but here the hashsets have two elements, and so on.
