  - what clever peeps on reddit were doing was searching rather than just
    checking, iow
  - for part A: for each elem in list, search for 2020-elem in list. With a set
    search O(1), you now have O(n) in total.
  - for part B: for each elem0 in list AND for each elem1 in list, find 2020 -
    elem0 - elem1 in the list.
    - when searching for elem1, it should be < (2020 - elem0). this can reduce
      the number of finds.

  Part 2 is apparently an instance of the 3SUM problem:
